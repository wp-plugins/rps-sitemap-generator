A lightweight XML sitemap generator with Multisite awareness.

It provides a familiar interface for viewing new or updated posts and making last minute changes before updating your sitemap. To top it off the plugin integrates seamlessly with Multisite. This truly is the bare-bone essentials -- what you need -- how you want it -- your life made simple.
